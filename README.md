Hello! I’m Joshua Opdam, a curious and enthusiastic student from Inner West Sydney, Australia.

I’m passionate about computing, robotics, electrical engineering, and social networking. This GitHub showcases the projects I’ve developed for various school-related assessments, including Software Design and Development, Information Processes and Technology, and Multimedia.

If you’d like to use any of my code, feel free to reach out! I’d be delighted to share the projects I’ve invested so much time and effort into.
